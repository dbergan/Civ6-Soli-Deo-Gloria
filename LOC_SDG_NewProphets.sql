('LOC_PEDIA_GREATPEOPLE_PAGE_SDG_GREAT_PERSON_INDIVIDUAL_GARY_RANDALL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1', 'Gary Randall was born in Madison, SD, on August 10, 1949, and was baptized shortly thereafter as an infant at Trinity Lutheran Church. At age 11, during a televised Billy Graham crusade, Gary asked Jesus into his heart and said he was never the same since. Around that same time, he started to teach himself to play the guitar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]His older brother and sister, Dean and Dianne, sparked his interest in music. They both could play the accordion and provided live music in their house when he was a kid. "And my brother could play the piano by ear," Gary said. "My sister played the piano pretty well too, but she did it by the book." After receiving a Harmony guitar for Christmas in 1961, Gary and music were inseparable. "No day went by when I skipped practicing the guitar."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gary started performing professionally in 1970 when he was a junior in college. He left Madison at age 21 with bass player Jay Nielson and headed to Minneapolis to join the house band for Arthur''s Four Seasons and The Flame. As they performed in the Twin Cities area, they were picked up by an agent and started traveling around the Upper Great Plains. A year later, he married his high school sweetheart, Debbie Pearson. "We''d play acoustic rock ''n'' roll... the Everly Brothers, James Taylor, the Beatles, Gordon Lightfoot. It was a pretty good era, when you think about it, for the quality of music."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then one night after a gig, there was an incident at the Flame in the Twin Cities where gunshots were fired. Gary wasn''t directly involved, but the encounter shook him. He and Debbie decided shortly thereafter that for the safety of their young boys they needed to move back to small-town Madison.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once home, Gary found other work to support his family, while booking gigs and teaching guitar lessons on the side. Since Nielson had stayed in the Twin Cities, Gary started performing as a solo act... playing both secular concerts with popular music covers as well as religious events like weddings, funerals, and baptisms. For many of these special occasions he wrote songs dedicated to the bride, groom, deceased, or newly baptized.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1991 Gary produced his first album of original music. Each song blends Gary''s peaceful finger-picked acoustic guitar with his multi-tracked tenor harmonies... all performed by himself. Few other songwriters can match his humble sincerity and spiritually acute lyrics. His music soothes the soul.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While Gary had always preferred spiritual music to secular, at this point his career turned exclusively toward serving Jesus. For the next 27 years he was performing concerts nationwide with invitations from Alaska to Houston, TX, and from Washington State to Florida. Randall performed with ministry events of all kinds at universities, retreats, and camps; and was always in demand for church services, weddings, and funerals. Several other albums of his work followed, including one of just wedding songs. In April 2018 he was inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with a Lifetime Achievement award.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gary believed that nothing related to making music is more special than performing live in front of an appreciative audience. He said the musicians can feel the feedback sent out by their listeners. "And for an artist, nothing can beat that positive feedback. Musicians appreciate that."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gary''s life left a legacy with his whole community. He was always ready to help, always ready to give, always ready to encourage. Gary never counted the cost of his time and never asked "What''s in this for me?" He didn''t pay attention to theological or doctrinal differences between denominations and you never knew which church he would be in on Sunday. His conversations centered on making someone''s day better and encouraging them to walk with Christ as their Lord and Savior. Nothing was more important to him. Even a quick trip to the grocery store could sometimes take an hour. He always had time for you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gary helped and encouraged a lot of strugglers throughout life. His philosophy was that no matter how bad someone''s circumstances had gotten, they could turn everything around with just one good decision.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The friendships and bonds he formed were always near to his heart. He wasn''t materially rich or successful in the eyes of the world, but held wealth beyond compare in friends and family. He loved the "open door policy" established in their home... he and Debbie didn''t lock their house, opting to instead trust in the Lord. And some days he''d be surprised to come home and see an old friend waiting for him on his couch in need of advice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Likewise, when Gary''s boys were growing up, they always had numerous friends over for conversation, food and fun. Sometimes the friends would beat them home from school and just hang out with Gary. These relationships carried over as the kids grew up to become close friends and admirers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gary enjoyed the outdoors, recreational biking, and tennis. He loved hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping in the Black Hills with his kids and lifelong friends.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the last five years of his life, Gary battled cancer, and through the struggle continued to serve the Lord. Just three weeks before his death, frail in stature and deaf in one ear, he put on a benefit concert in Pipestone, MN, and donated the ticket sales to an addiction treatment center that had helped a family member.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On November 17, 2018, Gary passed away. His funeral was attended by hundreds. The church was packed to standing room only. That was his treasure.', 'en_US') ;
