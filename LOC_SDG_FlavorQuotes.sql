('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER28_DESCRIPTION', 'There are moments of sentimental and mystical experience... that carry an enormous sense of inner authority and illumination with them when they come. But they come seldom, and they do not come to everyone; and the rest of life makes either no connection with them, or tends to contradict them more than it confirms them. Some persons follow more the voice of the moment in these cases, some prefer to be guided by the average results.

('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER29_DESCRIPTION', 'It is impossible that our mind could be other than spiritual. If any one contends that we are simply matter, this would put us even further from the truth, there being nothing so inconceivable as to say that matter knows itself. It is impossible to imagine how it could know itself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Man is to himself the most wonderful object in nature; for he cannot conceive what the body is, still less what the mind is, and least of all how a body should be united to a mind.

For we ought not to have more use and esteem of money and coin than of stones. And the devil seeks to blind those who desire or value it more than stones. Let us therefore take care lest after having left all things we lose the kingdom of heaven for such a trifle. And if we should chance to find money in any place, let us no more regard it than the dust we tread under our feet.', 'en_US'),

You were with me, and I was not with you. The lovely things kept me far from you, though if they did not have their existence in you, they had no existence at all. You called and cried out loud and shattered my deafness. You were radiant and resplendent, you put to flight my blindness. You were fragrant, and I drew in my breath and now pant after you. I tasted you, and I feel but hunger and thirst for you. You touched me, and I am set on fire to attain the peace which is yours.', 'en_US'),

('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER32_DESCRIPTION', 'Let''s worship Divinity, but understand the divinity we worship is beyond our comprehension... The correct description is that we try every day to become more humble when we talk about divinity, we try to realize how little we know and how open minded we should be. It''s self centered to think that human beings, as limited as we are, can describe divinity... We may find the Divine to be 3,000 times what we think it is now. It''s like asking the tulip there to explain you. The tulip is a beautiful creation, with millions of atoms cooperating with each other to produce great beauty, but ask that tulip to talk about you, and it can''t do it. It doesn''t have those perceptive abilities. Wouldn''t it be conceited to suggest that I had the abilities to describe the deity?', 'en_US'),

('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER34', 'Annie Besant', 'en_US'),
('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER34_DESCRIPTION', 'For so reverent is God to that Spirit which is Himself in man, that He will not even pour into the human soul a flood of strength and life unless that soul is willing to receive it. There must be an opening from below as well as an outpouring from above, the receptiveness of the lower nature as well as the willingness of the higher to give. That is the link between the Christ and the man; that is what the churches have called the outpouring of "divine grace"; that is what is meant by the "faith" necessary to make the grace effective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Giordano Bruno once put it - the human soul has windows, and can shut those windows close. The sun outside is shining, the light is unchanging; let the windows be opened and the sunlight must stream in. The light of God is beating against the windows of every human soul, and when the windows are thrown open, the soul becomes illuminated.', 'en_US'),

('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER36_DESCRIPTION', 'Most people, if they had really learned to look into their own hearts, would know that they do want, and want acutely, something that cannot be had in this world. There are all sorts of things in this world that offer to give it to you, but they never quite keep their promise. The longings which arise in us when we first fall in love, or first think of some foreign country, or first take up some subject that excites us, are longings which no marriage, no travel, no learning, can really satisfy. There was something we grasped at, in that first moment of longing, which just fades away in the reality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.', 'en_US'),

('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER37_DESCRIPTION', 'The first bambeday, or religious retreat, marked an epoch in the life of the youth... Having first prepared himself by means of the purifying vapor-bath, and cast off as far as possible all human or fleshly influences, the young man sought out the noblest height, the most commanding summit in all the surrounding region. Knowing that God sets no value upon material things, he took with him no offerings or sacrifices other than symbolic objects, such as paints and tobacco. Wishing to appear before Him in all humility, he wore no clothing save his moccasins and breech-clout. At the solemn hour of sunrise or sunset he took up his position, overlooking the glories of earth and facing the ''Great Mystery,'' and there he remained, naked, erect, silent, and motionless, exposed to the elements and forces of His arming, for a night and a day to two days and nights, but rarely longer. Sometimes he would chant a hymn without words, or offer the ceremonial ''filled pipe.'' In this holy trance or ecstasy the Native American mystic found his highest happiness and the motive power of his existence.', 'en_US'),

('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER40_DESCRIPTION', 'I saw an angel close by me, on my left side, in bodily form. He was not large, but small of stature, and most beautiful - his face burning, as if he were one of the highest angels, who seem to be all of fire: they must be those whom we call cherubim.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the iron''s point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The soul is satisfied now with nothing less than God. The pain is not bodily, but spiritual; though the body has its share in it, even a large one. It is a caressing of love so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God, that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may think that I am lying.', 'en_US'),

('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER41_DESCRIPTION', 'Nothing is inexorable but love. Love that bends to prayer is imperfect and poor. Nor is it then the love that bends, but an alloy of love.

Love is one and love is changeless.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Love loves unto purity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Love only sees the absolute potential loveliness of whatever it beholds. Wherever an object''s loveliness is incomplete, love spends itself to make the object more lovely, so that it may love it more. Love strives for perfection through perfecting the object. Love itself becomes more perfect in the object. It was Love who first created humanity, so even human love, in proportion to its divinity, will go on creating the beautiful for its own outpouring.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is nothing eternal but that which loves and can be loved. And Love is ever climbing towards the consummation when such shall be the universe. Therefore all that is not lovely or beautiful in the beloved, must be destroyed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And our God is a consuming fire.', 'en_US'),

('LOC_SDG_FOLLOWER42_DESCRIPTION', 'Christianity is the only religion on earth that has felt that omnipotence made God incomplete. Alone of all creeds, Christianity has added courage to the virtues of the Creator. For the only courage worth calling courage must necessarily mean that the soul passes a breaking point - and does not break. In the account of Christ''s suffering, there is a distinct emotional suggestion that the author of all things (in some unthinkable way) went not only through agony, but through doubt. It is written, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." No; but the Lord thy God may tempt Himself; and it seems as if this was what happened in Gethsemane. When the world shook and the sun was wiped out of heaven, it was not at the crucifixion, but at the cry from the cross: the cry which confessed that God was forsaken of God.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And now let the revolutionists choose a creed from all the creeds and a god from all the gods of the world, carefully weighing all the gods of inevitable recurrence and of unalterable power. They will not find another god who has himself been in revolt. Nay (the matter grows too difficult for human speech), but let the atheists themselves choose a god. They will find only one divinity who ever uttered their isolation; only one religion in which God seemed for an instant to be an atheist.', 'en_US') ;
